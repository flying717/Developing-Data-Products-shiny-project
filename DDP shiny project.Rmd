## Shiny application for predicting wage based on Wage dataset.

### Use the mtcars dataset to build a model to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG).

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
data(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```

#### Stepwise regression

```{r}
SW_fit <- lm(mpg ~ .,data=mtcars) 
stepSW_fit <- stepAIC(SW_fit, direction="both")
```

```{r}
stepSW_fit$anova
```


```{r}
final_model<- lm(mpg~wt+qsec+am, data = mtcars)
summary(final_model)
```
